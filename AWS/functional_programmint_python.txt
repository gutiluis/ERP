functional programming
    computation is the evaluation of functions
    programming is done with expressions
        passing the output of one function into another, either through chaining or by assigning the output to a variable and then using that variable
    no side-effects from computation
        do not change values outside of our function scope. We have to be careful with this when using mutable types such as lists and dictionaries
    functions are fist-class citizens
        functions can be provided as an argument to a function call or returned from a function. since functions are usable as values just like variables are, they're considered to be first-class
    functions should be limited in scope and functionality
        want to make sure our functions have a well-defined purpose. we want them to achieve a single task and then give us the answer from that task


procedural programming
    top to bottom evaulating each line

object-oriented programming
    concepts are broken up into objects, and then those objects have attributes and methods that do the work


chain functions together, 
take functions as arguments,
return functions as values


programming's work is done with expressions

functional programming relies heavily on objects? False?
